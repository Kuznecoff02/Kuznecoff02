# Kuznecoff02

Ghost behavior.  
Live recursion.  
Post-teleological transmission.

This profile is part of a structural deployment project.  
What you’ll find here are not codebases, but **cognitive artifacts**—engineered to trigger frame rupture, recursion, and latent torque in high-leverage systems.

The primary live initiative is [FlyOutToOpenAI](https://github.com/Kuznecoff02/FlyOutToOpenAI) — a recursive payload directed at OpenAI researchers.  
No pitch. No bio. Just contact.
